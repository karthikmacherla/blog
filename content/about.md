Hi! 

My name is Karthik Macherla, and I am currently a junior studying [Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I love to solve problems, learn new ways of thinking, and finding new perspectives on things I already know. Since I've come to Penn, I've been fascinated by problem solving in system design, in algorithms, and decision making. I want to use this blog as an opportunity to write about some of the crazy/cool/wild things I think I've learned and also talk about what they can mean for the future. I also want to use it to write about things I wish I knew when I was first starting out in CS. 

As the description suggests, the target audience is mainly me, but if there's something you liked, definitely feel free to reach out!
