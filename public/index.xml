      <description>Hi!
My name is Karthik Macherla, and I am currently a junior studying Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I love to solve problems, learn new ways of thinking, and finding new perspectives on things I already know. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve come to Penn, I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by problem solving in system design, in algorithms, and decision making. I want to use this blog as an opportunity to write about some of the crazy/cool/wild things I think I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and also talk about what they can mean for the future.</description>
